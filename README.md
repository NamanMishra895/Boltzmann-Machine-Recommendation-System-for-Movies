# Boltzmann-Machine-Recommendation-System-for-Movies
Restricted Boltzmann Machine for collecting data and predicting whether or not a user will like a movie.
This model uses 100,000 samples of movies, users and their ratings of any such movie. I've used the PyTorch library instead of tensorflow. The Boltzmann machine is trained in such a manner that whenever a new input is provided, it will tell the likelihood of a user liking that movie or not.
